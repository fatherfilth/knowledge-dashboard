<objective>
Deploy the Ryder.AI site to Vercel via GitHub integration, establishing the automatic deployment pipeline that rebuilds on every push to main and creates preview deployments for pull requests.

Purpose: Completes the end-to-end foundation by proving the site works in production. Every future phase ships automatically via git push.
Output: Live Ryder.AI site on a Vercel URL with automatic GitHub-triggered deployments.

  <action>
    1. Verify `npm run build` still passes after Plan 01 changes.

    2. Stage all new project files for commit (exclude .planning/ and .claude/ if they're already tracked separately). Key files to stage:
       - package.json, package-lock.json
       - tsconfig.json, next.config.ts
       - eslint.config.mjs, prettier.config.js
       - tailwind.config.ts
       - .gitignore
       - src/app/layout.tsx, src/app/page.tsx, src/app/globals.css
       - Any other scaffolded files from create-next-app

    3. Commit with message: `feat(01-01): initialize Next.js 15 project with styled Ryder.AI landing page`

    4. Push to the `main` branch on GitHub: `git push origin main`

    5. Verify the push succeeded and the repository is accessible on GitHub.

    NOTE: Do NOT commit .env.local (it should be in .gitignore). Do NOT commit node_modules/ or .next/.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `git log --oneline -1` shows the commit
    - `git status` shows clean working tree (excluding .planning/ and .claude/)
    - `git remote -v` confirms remote origin exists
  </verify>
  <done>
    All project files are committed and pushed to GitHub main branch. Repository is ready for Vercel import.

  <name>Task 2: Connect Vercel to GitHub and verify deployment</name>
  <what-built>
    Complete Next.js 15 project with styled Ryder.AI landing page, pushed to GitHub and ready for Vercel deployment.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
    2. Click "Import Git Repository" and select the `knowledge-dashboard` repository
    3. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js -- accept the default settings
    4. Click "Deploy" and wait for the build to complete
    5. After deployment, verify:
       a. The site loads on the Vercel URL (*.vercel.app)
       b. The Ryder.AI landing page displays correctly with styled design
       c. The page is responsive (check on mobile viewport)
    6. Go to Project Settings -> Environment Variables:
       a. Add `GITHUB_TOKEN` with a placeholder value (or your actual GitHub token if you have one)
       b. Enable for all scopes: Production, Preview, Development
    7. Go to Project Settings -> Git:
       a. Confirm "Auto-deploy" is enabled for the main branch
       b. Confirm "Preview Deployments" are enabled for pull requests
    8. Make a trivial commit and push to confirm auto-deploy triggers:
       - Push should trigger a new deployment visible in the Vercel dashboard

  <resume-signal>Type "deployed" with the Vercel URL, or describe any issues encountered</resume-signal>

1. Site is live on a Vercel *.vercel.app URL
2. Landing page renders correctly in production (Ryder.AI branding visible)
3. Vercel project has GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable configured
4. Auto-deploy is enabled for main branch pushes
5. Preview deployments are enabled for pull requests
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Ryder.AI is live on Vercel and accessible via public URL
- GitHub integration is active: pushes to main trigger production deployments
- Preview deployments work for pull request branches
- GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable is configured in Vercel (ready for Phase 2)
- Full stack verified: local dev -> git push -> Vercel deploy -> live site
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-project-foundation/01-02-SUMMARY.md`
