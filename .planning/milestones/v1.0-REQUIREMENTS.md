# Requirements: Knowledge Dashboard

**Defined:** 2026-02-14
**Core Value:** Your brother can quickly find and read any article in your AI documentation library

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Data Infrastructure

- [ ] **DATA-01**: Site fetches all markdown files from fatherfilth/AI-Documentation-Library via GitHub API at build time
- [ ] **DATA-02**: Frontmatter (title, status, category, slug, created, updated, author, tags) is parsed and validated with Zod schema
- [ ] **DATA-03**: GitHub API requests use authenticated token to avoid rate limiting
- [ ] **DATA-04**: Build completes successfully with all content from 6 category folders (models, tools, skills, repos, agents, projects)
- [ ] **DATA-05**: Files in docs/_templates/ and docs/_index/ are excluded from content

### Content Display

- [ ] **DISP-01**: User can read full article rendered from MDX with clean typography
- [ ] **DISP-02**: Code blocks in articles have syntax highlighting
- [ ] **DISP-03**: Articles display color-coded status badges (in-progress = yellow, complete = green, stable = blue)
- [ ] **DISP-04**: Articles display frontmatter metadata (created date, updated date, author, tags)

### Navigation

- [ ] **NAV-01**: Homepage shows a grid of all 6 categories with article counts
- [ ] **NAV-02**: User can click a category to see all articles in that category as cards
- [ ] **NAV-03**: Article cards show title, status badge, date, tags, and content preview
- [ ] **NAV-04**: User can click an article card to open the full reader view
- [ ] **NAV-05**: Each article has a unique shareable URL based on category and slug
- [ ] **NAV-06**: Category pages sort articles by popularity (most-referenced/most-updated first)

### Search & Discovery

- [ ] **SRCH-01**: User can search across all articles by keyword using Fuse.js
- [ ] **SRCH-02**: Search matches against title, tags, and content
- [ ] **SRCH-03**: Search results display with article cards
- [ ] **SRCH-04**: User can browse articles by tag across all categories
- [ ] **SRCH-05**: Article pages show related articles based on tag overlap

### Design

- [ ] **DSGN-01**: Site is responsive — works on mobile and desktop
- [ ] **DSGN-02**: Site has dark mode theme (dark-only; light mode toggle deferred to v2)
- [ ] **DSGN-03**: Site is styled with Tailwind CSS

### Deployment

- [ ] **DEPL-01**: Site deploys to Vercel
- [ ] **DEPL-02**: Site builds and deploys successfully with static generation

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Content Display

- **DISP-05**: Auto-generated table of contents from markdown headings
- **DISP-06**: Metadata display (dates, author) on article cards

### Navigation

- **NAV-07**: Quick stats dashboard on homepage (article counts by status)
- **NAV-08**: Keyboard shortcuts (/ for search, j/k navigation)

### Infrastructure

- **DATA-06**: Incremental Static Regeneration for content freshness without full rebuilds
- **DATA-07**: GitHub webhook triggers auto-rebuild on content repo changes

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Content editing in browser | Content managed in separate GitHub repo via VS Code/GitHub |
| User authentication | Single-user personal site — no accounts needed |
| Comments or discussion | Personal reference tool, not social |
| Database | Markdown files are the database — no Postgres/MongoDB |
| Real-time collaboration | Not applicable for read-only dashboard |
| Analytics | Personal project — no metrics needed |
| Git history view | High complexity, defer to v2+ |
| Backlinks | Requires link parsing infrastructure, defer |
| Reading progress tracking | Nice-to-have, not essential for single user |
